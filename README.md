# Rubik's Cube Solver
                                                                                       
3x3 Rubik's Cube Solver. It takes real time video as input and then steps to solve are demonstrated with live arrows in video 

##  Flow
1. Capturing Video
2. Detecting Edges of Cube (after doing some processing on image using OpenCV)
3. Extrating and Identifying colors
4. Feeding string formed into Kociemba algorithm
5. Displaying steps to solve Cube

##  Video
Following is the demo video
